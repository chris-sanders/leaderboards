The primary purpose of this project is for me to learn Go and it is not yet
fully funcitonal.

This project is a tool for backing up exporting and merge Local Leaderboard
vales for the Occulus game Beatsaber. The intention is to allow backing up the
Local scores to a database, sending that database to a server via sftp,
downloading other users databases, and then selectively merging the data into
your local data.

The original intention was to allow people to share their high score with
friends in the "Free play" mode.
